\description{
The \code{footer_image} function inserts an image into the page footer. The function
can be used to add a logo or other graphical element to the report.
The image will then appear at the bottom of each page.
}
\details{
The function assumes 
the existence of a page footer inserted by the \code{\link{page_footer}} function. 
If there is no page footer, an error will be generated during the rendering
process in \code{\link{write_report}}. If there is text
in the same cell as the image, the text will be disregarded. You may add text 
to other cells in the footer.

The "align" parameter determines which page footer cell the image will be inserted.
That is, if you align an image "left", it will be inserted into the left
column of the page footer. Options are "left", "right", and "center".  To
insert images in multiple cells, you may use multiple calls to 
\code{image_footer}.

The page footer cell width will take priority over the image width.  That is,
if you set the image width larger than the cell width, the image width
will be reduced to fit the cell.  To make a wider image, increase the cell
width on the page footer.  

Note that page footer cells can be removed
entirely by setting the width to zero.  This feature can give you more room
for a wide image. For instance, to create a banner image under the entire report, 
align the image "center" and set the left and right page header column 
widths to zero.

See the \code{\link{page_footer}} function for more information on
setting footer column widths.
